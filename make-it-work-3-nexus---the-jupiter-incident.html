</a></h3>

<p>This post is about making the game in the title run on linux. Might be helpful 
for anyone who has 3D glitches for this or any other games when played in wine.</p>

<p>Now after I had changed my linux distro to an arch machine I had to reinstall 
some of my games that I made run well earlier. These were sometimes cases that 
are much less interesting then disassembling GT97 racing as before so I did 
not blog about these and sometimes I had no notes on how to make them work.</p>

<p>Now as I redo these things it became visible that it is worth noting this kind 
of information too because one can easily forget what was the key and thus I 
can see now that others might be interested in the process too.</p>

<h1>State of the game as-is</h1>

<p>The first question that comes to your mind might be that why I am writing this 
here when <a href="https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&amp;iId=3179">WineHQ</a> has marked this game as "Platinum" - meaning there are 
practically no issues at all?</p>

<p>The problem is that there can be issues even if a game is marked platinum, for 
example I guess there might be some driver issue or just a rare issue that is 
only applying to my own case and not affecting anyone else at all and you of 
course still want to do something if you are like me and like to tinker around.</p>

<p>In my case the game actually installs and runs fast so performance is really 
good despite my game has less than recommended specs, but sadly also there are 
bad graphical glitches that make it unplayable. I tried both with the original 
wined3d and the stock microsoft d3d dlls and in both cases I get an issue in 
which <strong>the whole screen is blinking</strong> in white and sometimes red color.</p>

<p>After fixing all things I get a playable, smooth-speed software rendered Nexus:</p>

<p><img src="http://ballmerpeak.web.elte.hu/devblog/attachments/nexus/shot0.png" alt="Screenshot 0"></p>

<p>This blinking is not always there, but it depends on the camera angle and I 
kind of suspects that the small blinking lights on space stations or ships - 
the similar ones to what todays planes have in the night - cause this issue 
as for some reason the game makes the whole galaxy background blink instead of 
this single small dots. Easily it might be a rare driver issue or a rare wine 
issue or a combination of both but it does not seem to affect others.</p>

<p>It would be the best to fix this in the driver but I find it to be a hard job 
except if developers could tell me what they use for this small dots. It would 
be also a good idea to try turning these dots off, but maybe it is a deeper 
kind of underlying problem.</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>

<p>But if I am writing a tutorial, let as start with installation. I said that 
this game installs and starts up fast, but I lied a bit on the topic of the 
installation as the full-screen installer makes it pretty hard to change the 
disks and mount an other one using cdemu. This is a common problem and despite 
I am literally having this game as a boxed double-CD and a single DVD (haha I 
just like it so much I bought two versions - once coming together with gaming 
magazine dvd) I have practically no working optical drive in my laptop. This 
means I have to use a pirated copy and mounting with cdemu. This does not 
work well though.</p>

<p>The problem is that when the installer (that also bugs showing progress and is 
always showing 100% on the progess bard anyways) asks for the second disk, I 
just cannot unmount the current one as the installer holds it and even if I 
forcefully do so, it will not find the next mounted disk.</p>

<p>The way to circumwent this is easy though: <strong>just copy both CDs into an empty 
simple directory on your hard drive</strong> and start the <code>wine Setup.exe</code> there!</p>

<p><strong>You better choose full install here as you will see later!</strong></p>

<p>This way the game installed for me without any problems. Just telling this for 
those who might have a similar problem and only come to this blog because that!</p>

<h1>Using swiftshader and other software renderers</h1>

<p>To see if an other video driver would help, one can try to just use an other 
driver and an otherwise same system. I am not having a machine to do so, but 
sometimes I just try various software-emulated 3D providers like software mesa.</p>

<p>With this game I went further and just tried <strong>swiftshader</strong> - which is a nice 
software implementation for directx8 and directx9.</p>

<p>This is an open source product and you can even compile it for yourself using 
the <a href="https://github.com/google/swiftshader">github page</a> and you can build software opengl for linux there or the 
various directx 8-9 implementation DLLs and even software opengl DLLs for win.</p>

<p>The problem is that I do not have a win machine and visual studio at hand so 
I can not build the DLLs for myself so I had to rely on pre-built downloads.</p>

<p>Most of these downloads are for D3D9 DLLs only however as that is the main API 
this swiftshader gets used to emulate so far.</p>

<p>Using swiftshader over mesa and other emulation seems to be much faster to me.
When you run a game over wine, all you have to do is to use the for-windows 
DLLs of the software renderer, like d3d8.dll and d3d9.dll by putting them into 
the directory of the game and setting up wine to prefer native DLLs instead of 
built-in ones when natives do exists. You can do this in winecfg on the DLL 
overrides panel and set both d3d9 and d3d8 in the list as (native, built-in) 
which order tells wine that you first want the native DLLs (which it searches 
first in the game directory usually) and only if there is none there, neither 
an installed DLL in system-wide directories then use the wine built-in ones. 
Also here you can set to use DLLs this way only for specific game executables 
which is good for example if you have games that want this or that version.</p>

<p>So all you need to do is to download the own DLL of the software renderer you 
want and move it nearby the executable now - and hope the game really uses 
that specific API actually as some use opengl, some use only ddraw.dll etc.</p>

<p>Swiftshader will then generate the swiftshader.ini file upon first startup.</p>

<p>You can download versions that work for me here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://ballmerpeak.web.elte.hu/devblog/attachments/nexus/d3d8.dll">d3d8.dll</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ballmerpeak.web.elte.hu/devblog/attachments/nexus/d3d9.dll">d3d9.dll</a></li>
</ul>

<p>After putting these in the directory near the nexus executables and testing 
the game you might find that the dx9 version of the game comes as having only 
a blue-coloured screen and no ships when in battle mode. So I prefer to run 
this game in its dx8 mode from that on, which works perfectly but is slow.</p>

<p>Surely the game minimal requirements are this:</p>

<ul>
<li>CPU SPEED: 1 GHz processor (recommended: 1.8 Ghz)</li>
<li>RAM: 128 MB</li>
<li>OS: Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10 (32 or 64 bit)</li>
<li>VIDEO CARD: GeForce2 MX or comparable graphics adapter</li>
<li>SOUND CARD: Yes</li>
<li>FREE DISK SPACE: 1.8 GB</li>
</ul>

<p>My machine is a single-core 1.6 Ghz Celeron M which is already way below the 
recommended level so it is not a miracle that the game runs slow when not the 
GPU, but my CPU renders the whole screen. We can optimize swiftshader though!</p>

<h1>Optimizing swiftshader</h1>

<p>As I told you, SwiftShader creates an ini file when first started so there is 
some customization available. This basically lets you choose between speed and 
quality in most cases so I went on and changed everything to run the fastest 
while having the worst looks as that is good for me still.</p>

<p>The file with my changes is here: <a href="http://ballmerpeak.web.elte.hu/devblog/attachments/nexus/SwiftShader.ini">SwiftShader.ini</a></p>

<p>Basically I changed everything below the <code>[quality]</code> tag, set the texture mem 
to a size that my machine can still provide from main memory if needed then 
set thread count to zero for single threading and enabled SSE3 stuff.</p>

<p>I would be happy if anyone could ever tell me what the stuff below the 
<code>[optimization]</code> does for real. I see I can turn some passes on/off, but I 
have no idea what the passes mean so I did not go into guesswork. Maybe I 
could peek into the source code but I was lazy to do so.</p>

<p>After all this optimization, the game still runs slower than it should for me.</p>

<h1>Optimizing the game</h1>

<p>A good idea now is to look what you can do to optimize the game itself. This 
is a generally good idea in other cases too, but here I will present specifics 
for the Nexus game itself.</p>

<p>If you run a game with software 3D of course the first thing to do is to try 
minimilizing all the 3D effects through the official game config screens, but 
I am talking about the case when this is not helping.</p>

<h2>Using "datool" to decompress dat files</h2>

<p>There is a small tool to decopress Nexus, called "daTool". The version I am 
using is downloadable <a href="http://ballmerpeak.web.elte.hu/devblog/attachments/nexus/datool.exe">here</a>.</p>

<p>Usage (in game directory):</p>

<pre><code>        wine datool.exe x nexus_00.dat
</code></pre>

<p>This gets out the directory structure from the dat file. The other dat files 
are basically just movies and cutscenes from the game so you cannot unpack 
those with the same tool. For this to work properly you better install all the 
game data on disk (this took me around 2.4 Gb) so I advise to choose the "full 
installation" while in the setup.</p>

<p>After this operation you need to rename the original nexus_00.dat to something 
else otherwise the game will not start: will find both the unpacked and packed 
data in that case and fail for duplicates.</p>

<p>Decompressing these things are useful not only for creating mods and changing 
various stuff, but you have a chance to fine-tune rendering related options!</p>

<p>One relevant file is the <strong>universe/engine/rendering.ini</strong> for example. First 
I tried to remove effects randomly from here and see if it fixes my original 
problem but was not successful with this approach and I got some crashes too. 
It is worth knowing though that you can change particle systems directly here 
both for changing system requirements to be lower and for changing colors of 
the beautiful long particle streams coming from chemical engines to your likes.</p>

<p>Changing things here did not help much so I just reverted my changes and went 
to see other optimization possibilities for this game.</p>

<h2>How much screen resolution and vertex numbers count in software rendering</h2>

<p>Maybe you already think that using a smaller resolution can count a lot for a 
better performance, but I like to tell you why it can count even more in case 
you are doing software rendering. Before moving on why I change resolution to 
a forced and a bit weird small value, first think about why it counts so much!</p>

<p>If you think about software rendering for a moment you should see a really big 
bottleneck possibility! Games (and practically all 3D software) are either CPU
or GPU bound and usually when GPU bound you can tell if it is becuse of the 
fill-rate, the vertex numbers, draw/material counts and complexities or else.</p>

<p>A bit basic knowledge of 3D hardware rendering is needed here:</p>

<p>So basically on practically all dx8/dx9+ capable hardware you feed in some of 
the buffers with triangle data in the vertex and index buffers that you can 
load onto the GPU memory alongside possible textures. For every vertex data 
(vertex is basically and usually just 3D point - most likely endpoints of a 
triangle or a quad or the midpoint of a particle) a small GPU-loaded program 
will run on the video card parallel to all possible vertices as much as there 
are enough parallel processing units for that to change the vertex posisions 
and other attibutes like the color at that point. After this happens and the 
same vertex program also multiplies the vertex with the model-view-projection 
matrices one gets a flat polygon practically in screen space. <strong>Basically you 
can write a small programs that runs for all (or a set of) vertices possibly 
parallel and this is how from a bunch of 3D points you end up with a bunch of 
2D projected points using simple matrix maths.</strong> You can also do other things 
like if you make a particle system you might calculate particle positions here 
and the CPU only changes a "time" parameter instead of calculating everything 
on its own and only sends that along the "draw call" towards the video card.</p>

<p><strong>As you can see, when there is no GPU and you use a software renderer</strong>, you 
will have this code running on your single or at most several core <strong>CPU, it 
makes all the work for all the number of vertices.</strong> This is why vertex 
counts can count in software rendering. The good thing is that this code that
is written in the vertex shader are usually pretty simple for simple and older 
games - even good looking ones like Nexus.</p>

<p>After this programmable step this polygon is then further "rasterized" to form 
raster lines on screen (or in memory) that go through it and to tell basic 
things like if it is in sight or out of sight. This is usually less programmed.</p>

<p>After this step comes one more heavy weighting: going through these final and 
visible raster lines that contain non-empty data a small program will run for 
each pixels to determine the color of that pixel. The program that runs here 
is called the "pixel shader" or "fragment shader" and can be quite complicated 
even in case of older, but good looking games like Nexus.</p>

<p>Fragment shader is maybe a better name, because not only this might run for 
every pixel on the screen, but it might run if you render offscreen - like in 
case you render a TV screen showing a security cameras viewpoint - and not 
only that! Imagine that a thing called overdrive happens when we draw objects 
on top of each other when a car is front of a building and first you draw the 
whole building then a car on top of it in parts! Sometimes you can get around 
this by z-buffer tricks like early-Z rejection or HyperZ, but if there are 
semi-transparent objects like colored glass windows there is no choice!</p>

<p><strong>As you can see when there is no GPU</strong> with massively parallel chips only to 
calculate these pixel shader programs for 8-16 pixels at once, your <strong>CPU will 
need to run these complex codes at least once for every pixel!</strong></p>

<p>This is worse than vertex shading usually:</p>

<ul>
<li>Imagine we have an 1024x768 resolution</li>
<li>And the pixel shader can be done in 56 CPU operations</li>
<li>We have an overdraw of 1.2x (quite low, but this is space game)</li>
<li>Then we need to do 56x(1024x768)x1.2 = 56x(804864)x1.2 = 54086860</li>
<li>This is 54 million operations!</li>
<li>Now think about that this calculates one frame only!</li>
<li>I guess you want around 30 frames per second!</li>
</ul>

<p>It is easy to calculate that this is already a burden for the CPU and your CPU 
actually want to do other things as there is gameplay, physics, AI and other 
kind of things that it still needs to do and the original developers actually 
recommend a faster CPU than mine even when a GPU is on and working so this 
just does not work well as you can see.</p>

<p>A resolution change can make the middle multiplier quite smaller:</p>

<ul>
<li>804864 = 1024x768</li>
<li>480000 = 800x600</li>
<li>407040 = 848x480</li>
<li>307200 = 640x480</li>
<li>64000 = 320x200</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>As you can see, changing the resolution from 1024x768 to 800x600 nearly 
halves all the operations needed!</strong></p>

<p>Also some games might let you change the source code for its shaders and that 
might gain you multiplies of speed if you can manage it to make them simpler 
in case you do software rendering.</p>

<h2>Listing possible resolutions</h2>

<p>On linux you can list easily and well supported resolutions using <strong>xrandr</strong>.</p>

<p>The result on my machine is this:</p>

<pre><code>    Screen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1024 x 768, maximum 4096 x 4096
    VGA-0 disconnected primary (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
    LVDS connected 1024x768+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 304mm x 228mm
       1024x768      60.00*+
       800x600       59.96  
       848x480       59.94  
       720x480       59.94

<p>If you want to see hardware pixel numbers use xdpyinfo:</p>

<pre><code>    [prenex@prenex-laptop ~]$ xdpyinfo | grep 'dimensions:'
      dimensions:    1024x768 pixels (270x203 millimeters)
    [prenex@prenex-laptop ~]$

<h2>Setting custom resolutions in Nexus</h2>

<p>Nexus (at least the original non-steam release I have) stores configuration 
values in the windows registry. Not only basic things, but even things like 
the currently set resolution. The smallest resolution supported is just the 
1024x768 in the built-in config screen but we can try writing in any kind of 
random values here to force different screen sizes. There is also a value 
that changes between 16:9 and 4:3 aspect ratios and many other things.</p>

<p>The config values are here:</p>

<pre><code>    HKEY_OCAL_MACHINE/Software/Mithis/Nexus - The Jupiter Incident
</code></pre>

<p>and you can change <code>Display_Height</code> and <code>Display_Width</code> as decimal numbers.</p>

<p><strong>I choose 848x480</strong> here because that runs without any lagging and the UI is 
still pretty much usable - except the repair button in the pre-battle screen, 
but you can always start a game with normal res if you really need that repair.
Choosing smaller resolutions like 640x480 starts the game too, but the UI is 
not really becoming smaller so menus and in-game buttons end up on top of each 
other this way instead of just becoming unreadable. I could still play in the 
640x480 though and would be able to maybe win the original game in easy level, 
just I do not really advise it. The resolution I choose is horizontally much 
bigger than vertically but only a slight imperfection can be seen from this 
as the aspect ratio still tries to be 4:3. Performance starts to degrade at 
800x600 resolution only and with this there is still no lag and the bigger 
horizontal resolution fixes nearly all issues with UI. Even more than the 
800x600 resolution as most things are bad because things fall on each in 
the horizontal direction mostly. Aspect ratio is only affected by having a bit 
imperfect pixel sizes but you need to pay attention to see the effect.</p>

<p>It would be good to know about a hotkey for it though of course...</p>

<h2>Adding the New Conflicts campaign</h2>

<p>If you are like me and like the early Nexus gameplay a lot with the ships that 
create artificial gravity by having turning parts and "realistic" spaceships 
you should install the new conflicts mod immediately. This only works after 
you unpack the game dat files using the datool as it is not really a mod, but 
this thing works by changing the whole universe directory for something else.</p>

<p>The file is not that big and can be downloaded <a href="http://www.darkspace.de/nexus/download.html">here</a> or from <a href="http://ballmerpeak.web.elte.hu/devblog/attachments/nexus/universe_conflicts.zip">my page</a></p>

<h1>Game startup scripts</h1>

<p>There are other ways in which you can speedup wine games and few people tell 
you that it might also depend on a simple startup script. I tend to make a 
<strong>start.sh</strong> script for both dosbox and wine games when in linux and do all 
the necessary customization in there.</p>

<p>Possible customizations include:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC=60</code> - written before "wine" can make less stutter with various values (only pulseaudio)</li>
<li><code>WINEDEBUG=-all</code> - this makes some games a lot faster if there are many errors and warnings from bad api usage!</li>
<li><code>export RADEON_HYPERZ=1</code> - this makes hyperz and fastz-clear and such enabled for me (use what enable stuff for you! Use <code>man radeon</code>!)</li>
<li>Presetting screen resolution with xrandr (like <code>xrandr "-s" "800x600"</code> for ex.)</li>
<li>Setting up wine to start with virtual desktop for windowed modes: <code>wine explorer /desktop=title,800x600 "game.exe"</code></li>
<li>Setting 'nice' values for better process scheduling</li>
<li>Running custom pre-game and cleanup scripts (like music player for emulating CD-audio where not work or too slow)</li>
<li>etc, etc...</li>
</ul>

<p>I also find it better to not use pulseaudio at all and just rely on alsa only. 
I find it faster this way to be honest but some systems highly apply pulse lot.</p>

<p>Also an other possibility that one might think about is setting 16 bit color 
depth in Xorg.conf as it can help a bit with fill rates for many games.</p>

<p>My scripts: <a href="http://ballmerpeak.web.elte.hu/devblog/attachments/nexus/start.sh">start.sh</a>, <a href="http://ballmerpeak.web.elte.hu/devblog/attachments/nexus/conflicts_start.sh">conflicts<em>start.sh</a>, <a href="http://ballmerpeak.web.elte.hu/devblog/attachments/nexus/conflicts_end.sh">conflicts</em>end.sh</a></p>

<p>In this start script you see an example how to renice a wine application and 
give it a bit higher chance to get scheduled on the CPU than other processes!</p>

<h1>Final words - other possibilities</h1>

<p>After all the above the game runs pretty enjoyable and there is no slowdown at 
all! This is a pretty good achievement considering I use a complete software 
rendering approach apply wine as a windows-linux translation layer.</p>

<p>Even more surprising is the result knowing my specs:</p>

<ul>
<li>1.6 Ghz single core intel Celeron M</li>
<li>1.3 Gb available system RAM</li>
<li>256 Mb video ram (from the 1.5Gb total system RAM)</li>
<li>DX9 compatible Xpress 200M video card</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This is a machine that was a reasonably good midrange aptop in 2007!</strong></p>

<p>Basically the whole game is completely playable and to me enjoyable too!</p>

<h2>Other possibilities and good links</h2>

<p>In the end I think it is good to talk about other possibilities in case anyone 
needs help with their similar old-gaming experiences on linux or windows.</p>

<p>I just list these in no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li>Galium nine: This is basically D3D9 directly implemented in gallium drivers on linux instead of opengl translation. My card is too old...</li>
<li>DDhack: Useful old directdraw wrapper that make old DX1-7 apps calls translate to opengl. <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/ddhack/downloads">See here.</a> or <a href="http://sol.gfxile.net/zip/">here</a></li>
<li>DXGL: Usefule old ddraw.dll wrapper once again. New development but in alpha now. <a href="https://dxgl.org/">See here.</a></li>
<li>DGvoodoo2: These are originally "glide" (voodoo) wrappers, but the second one can emulate directx 1-7 calls too! <a href="http://dege.freeweb.hu/">Hungarian guy!</a></li>
<li>Nice page with custom ddraw DLLS: A guy makes custom to-gl translations for games he like that you <a href="http://sol.gfxile.net/zip/">download here</a></li>
<li>Fixing the driver... This would lead to heavy lifting like <a href="http://ballmerpeak.web.elte.hu/devblog/debugging-hyperz-and-fixing-a-radeon-drm-linux-kernel-module.html">when I fixed hyperz</a> but even harder...</li>
</ul>

<p>Also I want to share you a good blog of the guy who makes DDhack: <a href="http://sol.gfxile.net">here his nice blog is!</a></p>

<p>Feel free to share, comment or complain and stuff like that!</p>
