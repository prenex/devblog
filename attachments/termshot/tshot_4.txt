  Setting up my own ascii-casting on my blog

   January 18, 2019  Richrd Thier

   Uploading live-code like recordings is handy for a blog in many ways. My machine is not the fastest to handle easy MP4
   content creation software and I like lightweight solutions anyways.

   Asciinema is a nice app for recording the terminal. It closely resembles termrec and earlier alternatives but is much more
   stable when it comes to handling editors and other things. In this post I show how have I set up a javascript player for
   asciinema recordings to work with my minimalist blog using bb.sh (bashblog)

  Make it work: GT97 Racing

   January 16, 2019  Richrd Thier

   Once I had this game (GT97 Racing) and now found it in nrg image format so I thought it is time to retroplay a bit with
   it, to find out sadly that the game does not work because of copy protection complains when trying with the NRG, cdemu,
   linux, dosbox environment.

   The game uses CD checking in a way that does not work when the .nrg image is mounted with cdemu on linux and its drive
   directory is mounted with dosbox!

   This is because the CD is a mixed-mode CD with audio tracks and allegedly the length of the tracks are used as copy
   protection.

   I am leaving the company where I have spent the 5 last years doing numerous projects in numerous technologies, writing
   tenders, innovate and even do some amount of leadership (without any official title for the latter). I have poured water
