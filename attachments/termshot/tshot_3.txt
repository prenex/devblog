  Awsome linux tools I: Screen capture and stuff

   January 21, 2019  Richrd Thier

   When the idea of screen capture comes to our mind many usually think about the youtube-streaming stars and heavy-weight
   professional applications running on some then-hyped apple device or high-end PC computers.

   If you are recording CGI or gaming videos maybe these are necessary anyways, but there are more hacker-friendly,
   lightweight ways - and on linux. :-)

  Make it work 2: GT 97 Racing - "playing" the game

   January 19, 2019  Richrd Thier

   After creating the NO-CD version of the game it was time to play some is not it? It started out really hard and after
   perfecting the game while making it run without any lag... I have found that it is unbeatable on the first level even with
   a perfect drive!

   It seems the internet is also complaining on this: People write on various places that there are versions which are
   unbeatable and versiouns which are beatable. Instead of finding a right versioun I thought it is best to go and 'play' a
   bit differently - 'play' with some debuggers and reverse engineering tools.

   After all this became a much longer and harder journey than removing the no-cd code. The results are presented in this
   post, but if you are only interested in downloading the final binaries, scroll down to the posts end!

   Also if you just want to see how I removed the CD-checks, look for the earlier post on this very same blog.
