Debugging mesa and the linux 3D graphics stack

<p>Have you ever wanted to troubleshoot or even contribute to the linux graphics 
stack? Were you ever interested in doing a deep dive? Read on if you dare, but 
do not fear - I was rookie on the topic myself before I went for my hunt on a 
50-1000% slowdown after some updates and a distro change.</p>

<p>The power of open source: We can fix a more than decade old hardware getting 
a slowdown as easily as a new one! Fuck you planned obsolesence haha!</p>

<p>Lately I have changed my linux distribution from a not-much updated Ubuntu 
16.04 to a completely new Arch32 linux. Everything went as smooth as it can 
be with a distro that needs more hand customization, but 3D performance have 
become really slow for some reason.</p>

<p>This post summarizes my hunt for the problem - from analysing config files all 
through the end of adding my own quickfix in mesa source code! Yes you read it 
well. This post is a good reading for anyone who wants to start contributing 
to open source as this was my introduction to the deeper topics as well.</p>

<p>I think most software developers already (think that they) know much about threads. People know the problem of the dining philosophers, they heard how hard is to ensure correctness and know about tales of various threading related catastrophes. Despite this, however I still feel that there are many (not even poor) practical-only developers out there who still underestimate the various problems threading issues can introduce:
The kind of people who always argue (sometimes with understandable arguments) that "patterns and rules are good, but in practice you can break them 'for the real life'" or "in theory there are these or those problems, but 'reality is different' and you can live without this or that rule if the software is written according to the business demands (and you should focus that)" also tend to think about threading issues with the same mindset... This however just doesn't work in the case of concurrency - if you break it, it is utterly broken in many ways you are not aware of, and what is worse is that these problems cannot be found out by testing!</p>

<p>Because I want to spread some of the wisdom on this hard topic, I've choosen to write down some of my suggestions and some examples that I have found in real-life. I hope it makes sense and helps the readers.</p>

<p>As an addendum, I have chosen to use a nice little diagramming tool that I have found while lurking around the internet to make my illustrations readable from a console. I think this is something that I will try to do for the future too, as I want this blog to be enjoyable from elinks too (of course there will be exceptions I think, but it is better to minimize them in my opinion)</p>
