Technical lead

<p>I think I have found myself in a position that I thought will not long exist in todays world. I think I am not happy for this, because I always felt and know that my best skills are not technical. Strategy and chief key decisions are and abilities to talk with those that are extremely skilled. I am just skilled enough to understand what they need, how they will get a right environment to function properly and optimally. When however I am put in the roles of doing the most deep technical things and when they think I am the deep-tech guy, that means that those who have me right now have never-ever have seen any REAL talent at computer sciences. They do not know what they have lost with some of my friends that they did not hire when the projects were only 90% certain...</p>

<p>I never really wanted to completely retire from coding, but I would love if others would see me different than the "he can do everything we imagine" guy. It kind of insults me if people cannot ever imagine how things should work. Actually there are key cases when technical people are needed in lead - those who are nearly great, but actually only great up to be able to know how awsome the truly l33th4ckers are!</p>

<p>I wish once I can lead a company where we do make magic and there is no one who keeps us back. I hope I would not make mistakes like this.</p>
