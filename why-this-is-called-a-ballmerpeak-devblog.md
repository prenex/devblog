Why this is called a ballmerpeak devblog?

I think I have never answered this and there are no hints for it at all. Maybe some people would think it is because of some big underlying philosophy or who knows what else so I better clean it up haha: It is because I had to choose a username fast and at that day I have seen that "ballmer peak" picture on xkcd which was funny.

Not a long story isnt it? My email adress - which seems completely random - is actually more detailed than this ;-)

Oh: of course after I have that username on my university's server machine I'd better choose the same for the title of the devblog too, because it is in the URL anyways so it should make some sense. This is one of those cases when the result is there because of tides of the world randomly flowing and refactoring the meaning into the stuff only as an afterthought.
