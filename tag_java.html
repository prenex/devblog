<p>Along with trying to get things going - where we actually start to get interests in the Historical use cases of the Hololens finally as I have always dreamt of - I do some more usual development in a small team. I did fear it will be some kind of enterprisity with bloated technologies, but actually it is not that bad.</p>

Fibonacci cute

<p>Lately I was implementing a general task processing engine and people asked me if I can put in some retry strategies. The system is well elaborated, but long text going short - I have just found a cute way for calculating fibonacci. Actually because I have asked a question for a programming competition for calculating fibonacci (without telling what they need to calculate) now I have a lot of funny methods for it! Read more if you want to see the non-recursive, directly expressed math version and also a little code for the inverse of the function.</p>

Anti-patterns 1: @Transient fields vs. extender classes

The well-known JPA object-relational mapping API enables you to think of database entities like (java) objects. When you search up your entities or query results, basically you get objects whose fields are in correspondance with the columns of the database table. That is very good so far, but sometimes one might use a returned object like this in a GUI application to bind a visible table for the elements or such and you can easily get into situations when you want to extend your entity with some fields that are not represented directly in the database, but you want to appear in the visible representation - or you have similar problems. For those cases one can just create a new class, that embed the JPA entity in itself and provide the new fields - or does not even embed the entity just copy the data from it - but seemingly there is an other possibility that might seem faster: Just adding new fields for the JPA entity and marking them with the @Transient annotation as that means the JPA framework will not take care of that field and its value will never be in the database. Seems right? I hope that I can make you sure to never design code like that unless you really need to use this functionality - it is EVIL! ;-)</p>

<p>In short: I will present with an example why one should try to ensure the entity classes are containing only data that will be stored in the database without added business fields that are never presented in the database. If you need such extra information, create a class that has your entity and the extra information or use DTO objects, but do not use @Transient in new designs when not necessary.</p>

<p>Java has many interesting built-in and library tools for locking, synchronization and parallel/concurrent programming in general, but you can always find situations when the built in toolset is not enough or more often: not convenient enough. In most situations, the problem can be solved in some usual way, but you feel it is not the best way to do that and I think some of us create a generic solution in those times. This is how design patterns, practices and libraries appear and because I have found an interesting kind of lock that can be handy in many situations I have decided to share some of my code: enjoy my little solution that I call "LazyHashLock".</p>

<p>My plan was to write about aspect oriented programming in OSGi later as it would seem that both AOP and OSGi are happening out of nowhere on my blog, but my foreign collegue asked for the translation of our Hungarian company wiki that describes how to make it work. Because he asked me personally for this, I will just hurry a little bit and present something that closely resembles the translation of our pages.</p>

<p>I think most software developers already (think that they) know much about threads. People know the problem of the dining philosophers, they heard how hard is to ensure correctness and know about tales of various threading related catastrophes. Despite this, however I still feel that there are many (not even poor) practical-only developers out there who still underestimate the various problems threading issues can introduce:
The kind of people who always argue (sometimes with understandable arguments) that "patterns and rules are good, but in practice you can break them 'for the real life'" or "in theory there are these or those problems, but 'reality is different' and you can live without this or that rule if the software is written according to the business demands (and you should focus that)" also tend to think about threading issues with the same mindset... This however just doesn't work in the case of concurrency - if you break it, it is utterly broken in many ways you are not aware of, and what is worse is that these problems cannot be found out by testing!</p>

<p>Because I want to spread some of the wisdom on this hard topic, I've choosen to write down some of my suggestions and some examples that I have found in real-life. I hope it makes sense and helps the readers.</p>

<p>As an addendum, I have chosen to use a nice little diagramming tool that I have found while lurking around the internet to make my illustrations readable from a console. I think this is something that I will try to do for the future too, as I want this blog to be enjoyable from elinks too (of course there will be exceptions I think, but it is better to minimize them in my opinion)</p>
