Setting up my own ascii-casting on my blog

Uploading live-code like recordings is handy for a blog in many ways. My machine is not the fastest to handle easy MP4 content creation software and I like lightweight solutions anyways.

Asciinema is a nice app for recording the terminal. It closely resembles termrec and earlier alternatives but is much more stable when it comes to handling editors and other things. In this post I show how have I set up a javascript player for asciinema recordings to work with my minimalist blog using bb.sh (bashblog)

What could not be greater than creating a terminal recording about creating this blog post and setting up the environment - just to post it here?

This is really "meta" fun I think! :-)
