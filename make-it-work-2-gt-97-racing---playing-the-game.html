<p>After creating the NO-CD version of the game it was time to play some is not 
it? It started out really hard and after perfecting the game while making it 
run without any lag... I have found that it is unbeatable on the first level 
even with a perfect drive!</p>

<p>It seems the internet is also complaining on this: People write on various 
places that there are versions which are unbeatable and versiouns which are 
beatable. Instead of finding a right versioun I thought it is best to go and 
'play' a bit differently - 'play' with some debuggers and reverse 
engineering tools.</p>

<p>After all this became a much longer and harder journey than removing the 
no-cd code. The results are presented in this post, but if you are only 
interested in downloading the final binaries, scroll down to the posts end!</p>

<p>Also if you just want to see how I removed the CD-checks, look for the 
earlier post on this very same blog.</p>

<h1>Making the game run smooth</h1>

<p>First I present how to make the game run smooth. It actually plays really 
well even on my machine, but I have found out that it runs completely 
without any frame drops if I use the following dosbox setup:</p>

<pre><code>    windowresolution=640x480
    output=surface
    ...
    machine=svga_s3
    scaler=normal2x
    ...
    core=dynamic
    cputype=pentium_slow
    cycles=fixed 40000
    cycleup=10
    cycledown=20
</code></pre>

<p>The key point is that the <strong>cycles</strong> must be fixed for best performance for 
some reasons. The game itself is using 640x480 for the menu graphics and you 
can choose between 320x200 (when you choose VGA) or 640x480 (SVGA) graphics. 
Because of this I choose the dosbox window to have the 640x480 resolution 
and apply a 2x scaler which makes the 320x200 graphics I choose to a 640x400.</p>

<p>Choosing the 'surface' output mode tends to be the fastest in my opinion but 
it does not enable automatic scaling of the screen so we had to choose 
manual scaling. Also even with the 2x scaler the window will be 640x480 
which is smaller than my usual desktop resolution (otherwise I could use 
temple-os hihi) so the game would not fill the screen. To automatically play 
with the game filling the screen in 'surface' mode, I choose to create a 
small shell script that changes the x resolution before playing (yes... into 
640x480). This way the game is smooth like a silk and runs like a tiger :-)</p>

<pre><code>    #!/bin/sh
    xrandr "-s" "640x480"
    PULSE_LATENCY_MSEC=60; dosbox -conf ./dosb.conf
    xrandr "-s" "1024x768"
</code></pre>

<p>After ensuring that the game runs silk-smooth, excercising the gameplay and 
still feeling the game is unbeatable on the very first level, I went on and 
searched the interweb for more information.</p>

<h1>What others think about the issue</h1>

<p>First of all... I see there is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nENasN36Bbo">at least one person</a> who can beat the 
first canadian map in the very same 'Amateur' skill level I tried. This is 
something that ensures the game should be played normally somehow - yet the 
video on the link is from a pro player so I excercised until I play at least 
like him and ensure it is not a question of skill.</p>

<p>Below the youtube video, people are complaining that they cannot beat the 
game and some are saying there are versions of the game floating around that 
have some issue and do not let us win the races. They call these bad dumps.</p>

<p>After playing the game and comparing my gameplay to the video I realized 
and ensured: <strong>I literally get less time each checkpoint than the dude in 
the youtube video</strong>. I always get the same amount regardless what I do, but 
he always gets more.</p>

<p>On the canadian map this is what I measure against his:</p>

<pre><code>    me: +32, +26, +20, +13, +10, +5 seconds
    he: +36, +33, +30, +25, +26, +26 seconds
</code></pre>

<p>First it seemed that this might be related to the CD and the missing audio 
tracks - speculating they maybe contain checkpoint timing extras - but this 
is not at all the case as it turned out.</p>

<h1>First day, first ideas</h1>

<p>On the very first day I went on and opened the dosbox debugger right away 
with the intention to find the code that increments time at checkpoints.</p>

<p>With the dosbox debugger already set up (see last post), one can stop the 
game at any moment with ALT+PAUSE and get an interactive debugger with a 
window about where the program code is right at the moment. My intention was 
a bit childish: get as close to a checkpoint as possible, then pause :-).</p>

<h2>Better setup</h2>

<p>I have found out fast that in order for this to work, I cannot use the 
'dynamic' core type in the config as it is unreliable when stepping the code.</p>

<pre><code>    core=dynamic
</code></pre>

<p>I have already found out also that it is best to turn off sound completly as 
it fills the debugger log with IRQ requests and stuff like that.</p>

<h2>Finding the main loop</h2>

<p>The reality is that there is of course no chance to stop right at the moment 
of a checkpoint update - and in the relevant code parts. Also the game does 
a lot of stuff so just stopping 'before and close enough' is too far to step 
through the code until the checkpoint comes. I realized this in the first 
minutes of course so I made up a different strategy: to stop the code with 
the intention to find a 'main loop' of the race.</p>

<p>In most modern engines (at least those that are still single threaded) now 
there is a main loop that updates everything for this frame and loop over 
the next, the one after the next and so on, until we stop or win.</p>

<p>It is simple logic like this:</p>

<pre><code>    loop:

    forall obj: update(obj)
    forall obj: physics(obj)
    forall obj: render(obj)
    forall gui: update(gui)
    forall gui: render(gui)
    swapbuffers()

    while not end: goto loop
</code></pre>

<p>In modern well known engines like the Unity game engine for example this is 
implemented in an object oriented, component based fashion where everything 
that can be placed somewhere is a 'game object' and it has its own 'Update' 
and other engine-called methods where the engine just calls our "script" and 
let us do what we want to do in response to the call. In unity and modern 
engines one can put multiple srcipts and behaviours on an object which 
makes things more complicated. Not much though as this only means that the 
above update(obj) is not just directly one scripts 'Update' function, but 
it is first an operation that iterates all the scripts on it and calls their 
updates one-by-one after each other. Then there is a number that defines the 
order of the scripts and tells which comes after which. This is all visible 
if one thinks a bit below the roof of the engine while using it...</p>

<p>This is the loop we are searching for as it runs basically in every frame. 
Of course I did not even think that the loop would look like how I imagine 
the main loop of a modern, but single threaded engine, but I was sure there 
is some kind of loop and it will do the very same in some ways.</p>

<p>After stopping the game randomly, stepping around a bit in the functions I 
have found a spot where I can place a breakpoint and see it being hit in 
every frame. Before I got to this point I also realized there are some other 
methods that are called 18 (0x12) times per frame in this map and made note 
of this inner function exiting from which I got to a place that is called 
only once.</p>

<p><img src="http://ballmerpeak.web.elte.hu/devblog/attachments/making-it-run-gt97-racing-2/smo_frame_bplist.png" alt="Somewhere in the frame-loop"></p>

<p>The above screenshot is taken from the "frame" loop or call. From a place 
that seems to be somewhere in the main function very closely to it.</p>

<h2>A story about DOS extenders and debugging</h2>

<p>When I was at this point and barely found something that gets called only 
once in the main loop - but not even the main loop itself - I have found the 
tools a bit limiting. I started to map the source code on paper by drawing 
down what parts are calling what others but I remembered: this is what the 
famous debugger, the IDA Pro personal edition is for!</p>

<p>The problem was that I remember loading the game into HIEW32 it thought that 
the hackers view is facing a 16 bit dos application while clearly it is a 32 
bit one that uses some 'dos extender'. Extenders basically are small layers 
over DOS that change the processor into 'protected mode' just to use more 
than 1Mb or memory and some newer 32bit CPU features in DOS. The most famous 
dos extender is DOS/4GW which starts before many famous games like doom or 
duke nukem 3d. Most of the work done by extenders later became standardised 
by the 'DPMI' (Dos Protected Mode Interface) specification, but when that 
have happened most of the famous stuff already used DOS/4GW or something 
famous directly.</p>

<p>A DOS binary with an extender looks like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>16 bit code that loads the extender and some of its I/O stuff</li>
<li>16 bit code that changes to protected mode and jumps to 3.</li>
<li>32 bit protected mode modern code (application)</li>
</ol>

<p>So whenever a debugger opens the file it will guess it is 16 bit application 
by the first few (lot) of bytes. The main application logic is however 32bit 
and is coming later which will show up like a mess in the debugger and using 
maps that the IDA generates will confuse us more than help.</p>

<p>When developing, the developers first create a 'flat' executable in '.LE' 
format usually that only contains the third part with todays normally felt 
linear memory model and modern things that is later transformed into the 
final executable. As it turns out most debuggers can read this linear format 
so we only had to search how to remove the first two boilerplate parts in a 
way that gives back the LE source format instead of just the binary of the 
third part from a given offset.</p>

<p>As it turns out, <a href="https://blog.torh.net/2015/10/30/disassemble-dos4gw">there was a tool just for this cause</a>. So DOS32A became 
open source and it is an extender that contains a tool that enables us to 
remove the administrative stuff of other famous dos extenders, getting back 
the LE format and repack with DOS32A instead.</p>

<p>This sounds extremely nice so far, I tried it, but this is not a famous DOS 
extender and the tools did not work at all this way:</p>

<p><img src="http://ballmerpeak.web.elte.hu/devblog/attachments/making-it-run-gt97-racing-2/smo_extender.png" alt="game binary with extender version strings"></p>

<p>As it seems it is actually a very homebrew, rare kind that is made 
completely by the developer of the game (Blue Sphere made the game too).</p>

<p>No luck so far. I could choose to decypher the extender too or just stick to
the already used tools so far. I choose the latter.</p>

<h2>Interesting loops</h2>

<p>So I kept drawing and decyphering with pen and paper to find this:</p>

<pre><code>0008:3D310 loop begin
             runs 12x
0008:3D35A loop bottom
     !!! frame updates here !!!
0008:3D364 loop begin
              runs 10x
0008:3D3A2 loop bottom

0008:3D3AC loop begin
              runs 12x
0008:3D3F1 loop bottom

0008:3D3FB loop begin
              runs 12x
0008:3D445 loop bottom

if([12AA5]!=0) call 5231B

call 4FAA3 // sound?

call 3E2E5 // many-branch function

...
</code></pre>

<p>Oh... and when I say it runs 12x that means 18x because I counted in hex.
For the very same reason 10x above means 16x in human decimal system.</p>

<p>I marked where I saw the picture changing on the screen (frame update) and 
found these are part of the main loop of the game. Also I have found out a 
lot of other things like [ebp-24] is usually allocated by the compiler as a 
"loop variable" and that most of the times the loops are usual 'while' type 
loops with the looping condition first being checked.</p>

<p>As there is no such construct in machine language as a while loop, but there 
are jumps that can jump backwards after a comparison, I could even see that 
their compiler were using a really simple strategy: </p>

<pre><code>    jmp check
loopbegin:
    ...
check:  cmp [comparison]
    jnz loopbegin
</code></pre>

<p>Of course I am overly simplifying it, but you can get what I am telling.</p>

<h2>Video, sound and some free space</h2>

<p>For some reason I spend the remaining of the day with checking the first 
among the loops and the 4FAA3 call. The first loop was interesting as it 
seemed that everything updates on the screen after that is completed.</p>

<p><img src="http://ballmerpeak.web.elte.hu/devblog/attachments/making-it-run-gt97-racing-2/smo_retrace_trick.png" alt="Retrace trick"></p>

<p>The first loop turned out to not do anything else than what a modern world 
engines 'swapbuffers' call would do. It just gets the stuff really on the 
screen according to the video mode in use (either VGA or SVGA). It might be 
multiple times for many reasons, but I finally settled that they might use 
something that tries to quees which screen parts are actually overwritten in 
this frame and which are not - think of the lower parts saving of work with 
their nearly constant cockpit ui.</p>

<p>Also there were either dirty and tricky awsome hackz that not only tries to 
update the screen while a vertical retrace is happening (while the electron 
beam travels from the bottom to the top without drawing) but it seems this 
game actually tried to 'guess' where the beam might be and update the areas 
BEFORE the beam in a way that shows the state for the next frame. Because 
the areas are there where the beam already drawn this time, the use never 
see the tearing what I screenshot above. It is actually against tearing to 
render this weird way if you get it. I am not sure though if this is a bug 
or a feature in the engine, but after I have found out that the method is 
only about oldschool buffer swapping trickz and hackz I moved on.</p>

<p>Following my weirdness in simmetry I went on and tried something on the 
other end of my map about the main function: the last two calls I mapped out.</p>

<p>One of them were looking to be a really complex and long function that I 
started to call 'many-branch-function' or 'many-if-function' because it had 
a whole bunch of conditional cases and deep structure, while the other was 
ending in a pretty interesting data-copy that moves around 6kb data in RAM.</p>

<p><img src="http://ballmerpeak.web.elte.hu/devblog/attachments/making-it-run-gt97-racing-2/smo_fld_fstp.png" alt="fld and fstp"></p>

<p>To be honest I really got interested in knowing why this method is made the 
way it is programmed. In most cases programmers just tell a source and a 
destination address, the amount of DWORD (32 bit) data to move and issue a 
<strong>rep movsd</strong> operation instead of this.</p>

<p>What you can see here is that there is one floating point 64 bit load and 
one floating point 64 bit store which pairs we get as much as it is enough 
for moving the 6kb area - all of this directly coded with operations and no 
loops or anything whatsoever!</p>

<p>Aside this way it is possible to move 64 bits with one instruction, this 
kind of implementation rely on the coprocessor working on the data passing 
and every normal processor of the time and even today could interweave the 
normal and the coprocessor operations parallel to each other when possible.</p>

<p>The memory is shared, but if the CPU is not reaching out for the bus, it 
might have lead to some speedup. For todays machines this is however not 
only not that great of an optimization, but actually running this on a 
virtual dosbox environment must be much more slower than what a rep movsd 
would feel like. Also it eats instruction caches and have other bad things 
even on a real hardware but it was hopefully a gain at the time of this 
game was made.</p>

<p>I quickly acknowledged however that I can exchange parts of this data move 
with much more compact stuff and gain a lot of space for custom program code 
if I would need it.</p>

<p>From the size of the moved data I suspect this is doing something sound 
related, but it is a wild guess only. Also exchanging the call with NOP 
operations instead results in no change in the gameplay and I had the sound 
completely turned off already.</p>

<h1>Second day - some real progress</h1>

<p>Sadly I went on and got a hacker biorythm from this stuff - staying up until 
03:00 in the morning and more - but after wakup next day I had a good idea!</p>

<p>I remember that turning the 'sound' call on and off was easy-pie as I only 
had to exchange the opcodes and address of the call operation with <strong>0x90</strong> 
bytes which are encoding NOP (no-operation). So instead of the jump, the CPU 
just did not do anything for some cycles. I thought: why not just 'disable' 
parts of the program in hope that no crash will happen and in even bigger 
hope that I might find the meaning of the disabled parts by acknowledging 
what is missing from the game? :-)</p>

<h2>Render function: 3E2E5</h2>

<p>I have found out quickly that the <strong>'many if function'</strong> I mentioned before 
is actually renders the screen for example. If I disable its call, the 3D 
view gets frozen, but the GUI and overview map still works: also the timer 
still ticks down, I get time for the checkpoints and game logic works too.</p>

<p>I must tell I was quite happy that I do not need to go through analysing the 
'many-branch-function' because it looked a big complicated with all its 
special cases and branches. Now we understand that it does 3D calculations 
so there is a reason why it is so 'interesting'.</p>

<p>I also suspected the <strong>5231B</strong> function that it might be the one that is 
called when we hit a checkpoint, but turning it off completely did not do 
any kind of visible change.</p>

<h2>Car-physics loops</h2>

<p>Instead of mapping out more of the main loop (there are more to it still 
unmapped by me in the end as you can see), I went and checked this loop:</p>

<pre><code>...
jmp looptest
0008:3D364 loop begin
              runs 10x
looptest:  cmp,...
0008:3D3A2 loop bottom (jnz loopbegin)
nextpoint:
...
</code></pre>

<p>As I mentioned before, loops tend to be "preconditional" and first check if 
we need to do it once or not at all and how this is implemented with a jmp 
that basically misses the loop body and jumps to the checks in the bottom.</p>

<p>This compiler technique they used became really handy for us: to ignore the 
whole loop I had nothing elso to do than to change <strong>jmp looptest -> 
jmp next</strong> in the code which usually resulted in overwriting only one byte!</p>

<p>This is how the beginning looked in the debugger at runtime:</p>

<p><img src="http://ballmerpeak.web.elte.hu/devblog/attachments/making-it-run-gt97-racing-2/smo_orig_carcollision_loopentry.png" alt="The carphysics loop"></p>

<p>EB is the opcode for a short jump, with the following byte telling the CPU 
where to jump RELATIVELY from this location. This is a signed value so it 
can be a -127..+128 range from current code location. By adding a little 
we can practically always jump a bit further to miss the comparison and the 
whole loop for the first time - so it never runs :-).</p>

<p><img src="http://ballmerpeak.web.elte.hu/devblog/attachments/making-it-run-gt97-racing-2/smo_hacked_carcollision_loopentry.png" alt="Hacked carphysics loop"></p>

<p>After hacking out this loop I have found that all cars go through each other 
and their physics are basically not working. The physics that make them run 
on the track and collide with the racing track is still working, but this 
was a really interesting finding.</p>

<p>Later I made a version of the cracked game where this is added as a hack :-)</p>

<p>The loop right after this one relates to this loop directly: when that is 
'disabled' the very same effect will happen. I figure that one of the loops 
are calculating IF a collision happens between cars and the other is the one 
that actually calculates what the physical response should be on collision!</p>

<h2>Time-move loop</h2>

<p>Fast after the above I have found a very interesting loop that I called the 
'time-move loop'. When disabling this, no cars are moving forward and the 
timer in the middle and also the timer that calculates the complete time
being spent all stop working.</p>

<p>But hey! <strong>The checkpoint timer dont go downwards when this is disabled!</strong></p>

<p>This is the part what I am talking about (see the address to compare above):</p>

<pre><code>0008:3D3FB loop begin
              runs 12x
0008:3D445 loop bottom
</code></pre>

<p>We have clearly found a place that contains logic to decrement the main race 
timer so tracing that back to its operation we can find the memory address 
of the main timer count!!!</p>

<p>Interestingly the UI is still active and the cockpit animations were also 
active with the driver hand turning the wheel. Also when giving gas to the 
car it elevates a bit so forces are acting to it. The AI did the same and 
<strong>something funny happened: all cars blew up hahaha</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://ballmerpeak.web.elte.hu/devblog/attachments/making-it-run-gt97-racing-2/smo_carmove_loop_engine_destroy.png" alt="All cars blew up"></p>

<p>This have happened because the 'engine' blew up according to the simulation 
thinking it must be overused if we fully push the pedal and the car cannot 
go forward. Surely if we would face a wall tightly and push the gas pedal 
while the car is not moving at all - we would blew the engine in real life 
too is not it?</p>

<p>So we have not only found a loop that somewhere contains a call to a nice 
operation decrementing the main counter, but we have found a place we could 
use as a hack to destroy all the AI cars in the beginning.</p>

<h2>Homework excercise</h2>

<p>For those who follow up to this point and are interested, it can be a nice 
<strong>'homework' excercise</strong> to create a code somewhere that turns this loop on 
and off according to some keypress combination. I would change the fldp and 
stp operations function for sound as exchanging that with a shorter version 
lets you write a lot of user-defined code in that area. If anyone ever makes 
this excercise it would be nice if they add a comment so I can know about it.</p>

<h1>Hunt for the substract operation</h1>

<p>Because we know at this point that disabling this loop also disables the 
main timer ticking down in the middle, we went on to search for what makes 
it go down. For this I pick up my earlier drawings and started to analyse 
the code with pen-and-paper once again. This time going into more details 
while writing the operations. It is a near complete disassembly written down 
by hand and it contains a lot of arrows, marks and my pet-naming of what I 
suspect going on at that part of the program.</p>

<p>The most relevant and detailed parts are on the back of a big receipt paper:</p>

<p><img src="http://ballmerpeak.web.elte.hu/devblog/attachments/making-it-run-gt97-racing-2/smo_bigpaper.jpg" alt="Big disasm analysis on paper"></p>

<p>On the top-left corner is the detailed disassembly of the 'move-time-loop'. 
As you can see it basically iterates over ([12A99] + [12A9f]) number of 
things (maybe two 'kinds' of objects) and calculate some object / struct 
offset in the beginning. Here it is clearly visible that there is some 
vector-kind data structure of various 'objects' for which we calculate their 
base memory address (the beginning of the object) in the <strong>EDI register</strong>.
Also after we look enough time: The loop counter is in <strong>[EBP-24]</strong>. This is 
what counts upwards until it reach ([12A99] + [12A9f]) times.</p>

<p>What is interesting is that the middle of the loop checks [EDI+26] and calls 
something only if this is not -1 when taken as a byte (cmp with FF).</p>

<p>This 'field' of the object I already defined as <strong>type</strong> at <strong>[EDI+26]</strong>. I 
kind of suspected that a type of kind of (-1) is basically an inactive game 
object and does not need to be updated. It is like when the little 'enable' 
tick is ticked off in modern engines like Unity :-).</p>

<p>Actually it was only at this point where I started to suspect that the game 
is actually really well structured and nearly follows what modern 3D engines 
are doing below the hood. Of course there is a reason why engines do stuff 
like they do today and it is because developers already programmed games in 
that very way for ages, but for some reason I expected the code to be just 
like a spaghetti of put-together stuff. I must tell that there was really 
nice order in the game code and after getting used to what you see and after 
mapping it out on paper it started to have a really clean structure with 
different things separated really nicely.</p>

<p>But going back on track: this loops calls <strong>0008:43675</strong> for all active 
objects and that function must be some <strong>'object update function'</strong> after 
all isnt it? All the other parts of this page are details about this big 
and generic update function.</p>

<p>They did not put together a 'scripting' interpreter, but here they basically 
seperated different kinds of objects by analysing their 'type' and 'subtype' 
fields. Basically this is where they wrote what todays coders write in the 
'Update' functions of a unity game object and they wrote the updater code 
just below the proper type and subtype comparisons. Of course the compiler 
could optimize this and the structure is much more broken in binary because 
of the tricks the compiler was made to make it run faster, but the generic 
structure still shines through.</p>

<p>As you can see this object-update function is quite big: I had to write with 
smaller and smaller letters and got out of space on paper even that way haha.</p>

<p>I had to use the other side of the paper:</p>

<p><img src="http://ballmerpeak.web.elte.hu/devblog/attachments/making-it-run-gt97-racing-2/smo_bigpaper_back.jpg" alt="Big disasm analysis on paper 2"></p>

<p>After all this work, I started to look like a mad scientist or 'pr0 H4Xx0R':</p>

<p>and it became 03:00 once again with flashlight of my mobile phone running 
out of battery power completely so it was time to sleep...</p>

<h1>Third day - real breakthrough</h1>

<p>Somehow I got up before 12:00 and had a terrible-good idea: let find <strong>sub</strong> 
operations in code I mapped out from the object-update function suspecting 
that they are the ones responsible for making the middle timer going down!</p>

<p>I just choose every sub operation on memory that I found relevant, then 
started to replace them with the good old NOP (0x90) operations.</p>

<h2>Not-ticking timer</h2>

<p>I have quickly found this part - before 12:00 that day:</p>

<pre><code>    mov dword [edi+4E], eax
    mov eax, [edi+52]
    test eax, eax
    jz 4394B

    movzx eax, [1292D]
    sub [edi+52], eax  (HERE)
    mov eax,[edi+52]
    cmp eax,C8
    jge 43949
    mov dword [edi+52], 0
</code></pre>

<p>When I removed the <strong>substraction at the (HERE) marker</strong> I have found the 
main <strong>timer</strong> in the middle of the screen <strong>not ticking</strong> down anymore!!!</p>

<p><img src="http://ballmerpeak.web.elte.hu/devblog/attachments/making-it-run-gt97-racing-2/smo_timehackz.png" alt="Removing the timer ticks"></p>

<p>This is how it looks after making the above changes (nopping-out the sub):</p>

<p>Actually many people complained below the youtube video that they would have 
been much more happy with the game if it would not have the checkpoint 
timer at all so I could stop here and just play through the game happily.</p>

<p>I actually created an executable that has this hack in it for those who want 
to just completely ignore the timed part of the game and only want to race 
against the AI cars. However while trying to beat the game the first time 
I remember how the timer added a real sense of urgency to the game and how 
it made an emphasis on trying to drive as fast as I can! I did not wanted to 
lose that feeling with my hack on the executable so I went on to somehow try 
'fixing' the time that the checkpoints gave me badly.</p>

<h2>Analysis of the checkpoint timer code</h2>

<p>There was one thing that bugged me a lot: When I placed a breakpoint into 
this region of the code, it would hit this many times in every frame. This 
is quite interesting as there is of course only one timer on the screen and 
only one timer the affect the gameplay at all.</p>

<p>Also the <strong>C8</strong> comparison after the nullification of the variable seems to 
mean to me, that 'C8' (=200 in decimal) was some special delta-value under 
which everything is considered to be zero seconds. The top part of the code 
is checking the timer against zero, while the bottom part is the one that 
substracts from it in every frame. It seems the amount we need to substract 
is actually a calculated value in the <strong>[1292D]</strong> memory location. The 
latter is natural as more or less real time happens between frames depending 
on how fast the gamers machine is.</p>

<p>Also because this substraction is happening in every frame, of course the 
variable does not contain the timer value directly: it contains some integer 
value that basically <em>represent</em> a fixed point time in seconds from which we 
can get the seconds by a simple division.</p>

<h2>Two ways to represent checkpoint bonus times</h2>

<p>At this time I started to think why there is this code that substracts time 
values from various locations in every frame instead of just substracting 
from one place from where the main timer is reading its value?</p>

<p>Then I got an 'enlightement' feeling: Wow, maybe the track editor is not 
editing 'how much time each checkpoint gives to the player', but they might 
edit 'how much time the player has ABSOLUTELY to reach this checkpoint'?</p>

<p>This is a completely different kind of thinking and it makes some sense and 
is actually maybe much more simple for gameplay balancing in the end!</p>

<p>If this is how the checkpoints are represented, maybe they get loaded in the 
beginning of the race from file and the game substracts from all of these 
values from various checkpoints and the counter the user sees only shows the 
value for the currently active region. This would make sense in a way too.</p>

<p>If this is true however, I am a bit stuck as it is very well possible that 
the track data files contain these values directly and it is just loaded in 
with a file I/O operation in a binary way I cannot change its behaviour. If 
this would be true I would need to work a lot more in the direction of 
reverse engineering the track file format of the game...</p>

<h2>What happens with the timer when a map gets loaded</h2>

<p>After finding that I need to use the BPPM (BreakPoint to Protected Memory) 
command of the dosbox debugger instead of the normal memory breakpoint for 
some reason, I put a breakpoint to one of the locations where [EDI+52] was 
pointing to according to the debugger when I was near the substraction and 
with this breakpoint I tried to find out who else modifies the area.</p>

<p>I went an restarted the race which made the game load the track file once 
again and the breakpoint got activated as I suspected it will be.</p>

<p>This is how it looks when the same memory area is written to on map loading:</p>

<pre><code>8:43BFF push edi
    inc eax
    movzx edx, [eax+2]

    imul edx,edx, C8 // edx *= 200
    add edx, C7      // edx += 199

    mov [edi+52], edx
    mov [ebp-1C], eax
    mov [ebp-18], edx
</code></pre>

<p>This is not simple I/O, but there is some processing! Wow I became happy!</p>

<p>I quickly realized what is happening here:</p>

<ul>
<li>The track data files contain checkpoint timing data in seconds!</li>
<li>and <strong>one second = 0xC8 = 200</strong> in the fixed point representation!</li>
<li>The addition after the multiplication corresponds the 'delta' value we saw.</li>
</ul>

<p>So they load some value from the track files into the EDX register and this 
is the value in seconds so we need to multiply this by 200 which makes this 
correspond to the scale of the fixpoint representation, while the addition 
is only there because every value less than 200 is considered zero as we <br />
have already found it out above.</p>

<p>This is really awsome to us, because this code runs for all the checkpoints 
if our logic was true in the last chapter and we can change either the 
multiplier, the constant for addition - or both - to fit our goals to get 
similar time bonuses at checkpoint like the guy in the youtube video I am 
using as a reference to fix the implementation!</p>

<p>Also because the value of 200 is one seconds and here the code originally 
multiplies with that, <strong>we can work with fractionals</strong>: multiplying with a 
value of 0x190 (=400) means every checkpoint will give two times bigger time 
and multiplying with 0x64 (=100) would mean we half every time the track 
file contains for every checkpoint.</p>

<h2>Calculating new timing function</h2>

<p>If we consider the original checkpoint timings as a series, we can think of 
this small code snippet as a function over every element of that series. So 
in case (x1): 32, 26, 20, 13, 10, 5, ... as I have measured it, we can tell:</p>

<pre><code>    (x2)[i]:= (x1)[i] * val-1 + val-2
</code></pre>

<p>as we choose it to fit our goals! With quick calculation on pen and paper I 
came up with choosing val-1 as 1/2 and val-2 as 20 seconds. That way we can 
get really close - nearly perfectly close - to what we see in the YT-vid!</p>

<p>After making the changes however I have found even though I have more time 
I still cannot beat the first level of the game! Wow! How is that?</p>

<h2>Realizing why there are multiple counters</h2>

<p>After playing a few races it became clear that my change is not working as 
I hoped and expected. Instead of getting extra time at every checkpoint it 
seems I only managed to get a one-time extra time at the beginning of the 
race. This could be good-enough if I would be lazy, but it leads to really 
bad gameplay if I would try to just give enough starting time instead of <br />
the checkpoints giving their proper times, but how this have happened?</p>

<p>Then I got an other 'enlightement' moment: Oh, my last enlightement moment 
was actually completely bad and untrue! We get extra times at checkpoints 
and there is only one timer. But then why is there more timers for some 
weird reason? After breakpointing on them I have found out they are for the 
other cars! Wow! Even though it does not affect gameplay, they also have 
their own checkpoint counters!</p>

<p>Maybe the developer was thinking about adding multiplayer possibilities or 
game modes where AI cars could lose out to time but ditched this idea? Or 
maybe they already had a half-done homebrew 3D engine from an other game of 
theirs that had this possibility? I do not know, but this is fully 
calculated through the race and this was what gave me a bit of a circle 
around the truth about the gameplay logic.</p>

<p>Then there must be a code that adds to this value somewhere when we pass a 
checkpoint, just I do not know where! Also it is really hard to put a memory 
breakpoint on that code because these are all changed downwards for all the 
cars in every frame so I will stop in every frame with the debugger (8-10x).</p>

<h2>Smarter memory breakpoint</h2>

<p>It seemed that I would need one another long analysis to find an 'add' 
operation similar to the way how I have found the substraction - with the 
good old pen-and-paper analysis and mapping out more of the update function.</p>

<p>Before starting this mechanically however I had a brilliant idea thank God: 
If I already know that 200 = 1 seconds in the representation, why do not I 
put a <strong>memory breakpoint only on the second 16 bits</strong> of the time variables?</p>

<p>This way I get a breakpoint only one time per second AND when we are passing 
the checkpoint and it updates the whole counter! The checkpoint always gives 
more than one seconds, while the subtraction affects this only per seconds.</p>

<p>This way I went close to a checpoint gate with maximum speed, paused the 
game, activated the breakpoint on the second 16 bits of the variables and 
let the game loose.</p>

<p>I have found what I was searching for and checked it back:</p>

<p><img src="http://ballmerpeak.web.elte.hu/devblog/attachments/making-it-run-gt97-racing-2/smo_my_timer_validated.png" alt="My timer variable"></p>

<p>As you can see I have found it is <strong>0x2C75</strong> after the change, which equals 
to <strong>11381</strong> in decimal. Divided it by 200 (to get seconds) <strong>we got 56.9</strong> 
and we see we are having <strong>57 shown</strong> on the timer. Our theory is good!</p>

<h2>Fixing the checkpoint times</h2>

<p>After knowing the real memory address we need to look for, we quickly also 
found a code that calculates how much bonus time we will get. This code is 
also applying to all other cars of course (maybe even non-race cars).</p>

<p><img src="http://ballmerpeak.web.elte.hu/devblog/attachments/making-it-run-gt97-racing-2/smo_relevant_point_1.png" alt="Relevant code to hack"></p>

<p>As you can see this is basically a really similar code to what we have seen
earlier when te game loads in. It might be this is actually the very same 
function in a high level language but is 'inlined' by the compiler.</p>

<p>The maths in the 'calculating new timing function' chapter applies here as 
well so what we had to do is to change this in the debugger while the game 
is still running in the dosbox window and check the result.</p>

<p>I made a terminal recording about the hacking process:</p>

<h1>4th day and finalization</h1>

<p>I went to sleep late once again, but even more happy than any other day. The 
problem seems to be solved and only minor stuff remained to do.</p>

<p>These were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Creating hacked binaries with HIEW32 (hackers view)</li>
<li>Testing the resulting game - functionally and for gameplay quality</li>
<li>Minor adjustments</li>
<li>Writing the blog post, gathering pictures, uploading to server etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Creating the binary was fast:</p>

<p><img src="http://ballmerpeak.web.elte.hu/devblog/attachments/making-it-run-gt97-racing-2/smo_gt_hiew.png" alt="HIEW32 (hackers view)"></p>

<h2>Adjustments and testing</h2>

<p>Playing with the game however became too easy for my feeling so I adjusted 
the values to became a bit harder. I still half all the bonus times encoded 
in the track data files, but instead of giving it +20 extra seconds to them 
constantly I only give +18. This resulted in a much more tight gameplay, 
that I find still beatable. I provided both this and the original hack that 
corresponds more closely what you can see on the youtube video.</p>

<p>Writing the post and gathering all the stuff also resulted in a lot of time 
being gone from my life, but I thought it is fun to share my journey.</p>

<h2>Possibilities to enchance my work</h2>

<p>As you know: because of parts of the game code that can be minified, there 
is actually a possibility to add really complex extra game logic so in case 
anyone else wants to play with the game in the hackers way, they still have 
a lot of nice things to discover on their own.</p>

<p>With the memory breakpoint possibility we can also find the code that is 
processing the track data files if you follow my debugging up to that point. 
This might be of interests for those who want to find how the files store 
the track data and want to build a map editor or something. I think it is 
possible if you are willing to give in a similar amount - or more - work!</p>

<h1>Downloads</h1>

<p>Download the hacked GTRACING.EXE executables:</p>

<p><a href="http://ballmerpeak.web.elte.hu/devblog/attachments/making-it-run-gt97-racing-2/gt97_crk.zip">Download executables (.zip)</a></p>

<p>Contents:</p>

<pre><code>    nocd_only: only removes copy protection
    nocd_checkfix: checkpoint time fixes - contains easy and norm
    nocd_notimer: timer never goes downwards
    nocd_fullhackz: everything + no collision with cars
</code></pre>

<p>Just choose the version to your liking and copy the exe over the original! I 
advise to try the 'nocd checkfix' version without choosing the 'easier' 
executables first. That seems to be the closest to what the game designers 
originally meant the game to be played like.</p>

<p>PS.: I think I had to go through this deephackz because I posed with a 
hackerman picture earlier. Now I can hopefully deserve it more even though 
it must be God that helped me not get stuck in the bunch of machine code...</p>
