The "Successful" software development leadership method: Essence-oriented development?

<p>Agile answers a lot, but what we need to keep is focus on doing what is to be done. Whenever we do not do what is the necessary or lose focus on the key aspects, we lose focus on success of a project.</p>

<p>After being in many projects, I kind of feel Agile, Scrum and such are bad words and altough having mostly good in their approach there is something that should be having an ever greater impact: the essence.</p>

<p>The leadership style I am talking about should be better called "minimal feature - maximal essence development". In through that process, the maximum focus is on the relevant work to be done, the "essence" to add - and of course the ability to not only add this essence but to ship a product (let it be open or closed source) that this essence is incorporated into.</p>

<p>Most of the scary stuff are automatically handled with such a mindset: overdesign, underdesign, agility, team-spirit, susteinability, MWP, measure vs. estimate, business value increments, iterations, proper - but not unnecessary - documentation, etc. etc.</p>

Threads: Why you should hate and love them 1

<p>I think most software developers already (think that they) know much about threads. People know the problem of the dining philosophers, they heard how hard is to ensure correctness and know about tales of various threading related catastrophes. Despite this, however I still feel that there are many (not even poor) practical-only developers out there who still underestimate the various problems threading issues can introduce:
The kind of people who always argue (sometimes with understandable arguments) that "patterns and rules are good, but in practice you can break them 'for the real life'" or "in theory there are these or those problems, but 'reality is different' and you can live without this or that rule if the software is written according to the business demands (and you should focus that)" also tend to think about threading issues with the same mindset... This however just doesn't work in the case of concurrency - if you break it, it is utterly broken in many ways you are not aware of, and what is worse is that these problems cannot be found out by testing!</p>

<p>Because I want to spread some of the wisdom on this hard topic, I've choosen to write down some of my suggestions and some examples that I have found in real-life. I hope it makes sense and helps the readers.</p>

<p>As an addendum, I have chosen to use a nice little diagramming tool that I have found while lurking around the internet to make my illustrations readable from a console. I think this is something that I will try to do for the future too, as I want this blog to be enjoyable from elinks too (of course there will be exceptions I think, but it is better to minimize them in my opinion)</p>
